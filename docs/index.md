## Key Concepts

### What is GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)?

GRPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm for training language models. Unlike supervised learning (which simply teaches the model to imitate examples), GRPO teaches the model to maximize rewards.

**How GRPO Works:**
1. Model generates multiple responses for each prompt
2. Reward function scores each response
3. Model learns to increase probability of high-reward responses
4. Model learns to decrease probability of low-reward responses

**Benefits:**
- Models learn to optimize for specific objectives (correctness, format, style)
- Better generalization than pure supervised learning
- Can improve beyond training data quality

**GRPO vs Other Algorithms:**
- **GRPO**: Token-level importance weighting (standard)
- **GSPO**: Sequence-level optimization (simpler, less granular)
- **OR-GRPO**: Outlier-robust variant (handles noisy rewards better)

### What are LoRA Adapters?

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method.

**Key Concepts:**
- Instead of updating all model parameters (billions), LoRA adds small "adapter" layers
- Adapters are typically 1-2% the size of the full model
- Base model remains frozen, only adapters are trained
- Multiple adapters can be applied to the same base model

**Benefits:**
- **Memory Efficient**: Train on consumer GPUs (4-8GB VRAM)
- **Fast Training**: Fewer parameters to update
- **Easy Sharing**: Adapter files are small (typically 10-100MB)
- **Modular**: Switch adapters for different tasks

**LoRA Parameters:**
- **Rank**: Number of dimensions in adapter (higher = more capacity, slower training)
- **Alpha**: Scaling factor (controls adapter influence)
- **Dropout**: Regularization to prevent overfitting

### Understanding Reward Functions

Reward functions are Python functions that evaluate model outputs and return scores.

**Components of a Reward Function:**
1. **Input**: Model's generated response + reference data
2. **Evaluation Logic**: Checks correctness, format, quality
3. **Output**: Numerical score (typically 0.0 to 1.0)

**Example: Math Reward Function**
```python
def math_reward(response, expected_answer):
    # Extract answer from response
    model_answer = extract_solution(response)

    # Check correctness
    if model_answer == expected_answer:
        return 1.0  # Correct
    else:
        return 0.0  # Incorrect
```

**Types of Reward Functions:**
- **Exact Match**: Binary reward (correct/incorrect)
- **Partial Credit**: Gradual scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Multi-Component**: Combines multiple criteria (correctness + format + efficiency)
- **Heuristic**: Rule-based evaluation
- **Model-Based**: Uses another model to evaluate quality

**Best Practices:**
- Start with simple, interpretable reward functions
- Ensure rewards align with your desired behavior
- Test rewards on sample data before training
- Monitor reward distributions during training

### Understanding System Prompts

System prompts define the instruction format and expected output structure.

**Components:**
- **System Message**: High-level instructions for the model
- **Instruction Template**: How to format input prompts
- **Response Template**: Expected output structure
- **Special Markers**: Tags for reasoning and solutions

**Example System Prompt (GRPO Default):**
```
You are given a problem.
Think about the problem and provide your working out.
Place it between <start_working_out> and <end_working_out>.
Then, provide your solution between <SOLUTION></SOLUTION>
```

**Why Use Structured Outputs?**
- Separates reasoning from final answer
- Makes reward function evaluation easier
- Improves model interpretability
- Enables extraction of specific components

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Memory Issues

**Problem**: "CUDA out of memory" error during training

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce batch size to 1
2. Increase gradient accumulation steps (maintains effective batch size)
3. Reduce max sequence length (e.g., 2048 â†’ 1024)
4. Use smaller model (e.g., 1.7B instead of 4B)
5. Enable gradient checkpointing (trades compute for memory)
6. Use 8-bit or 4-bit quantization (reduces memory usage)

### Training Not Starting

**Problem**: Training session created but doesn't start

**Solutions:**
1. Check logs folder for error messages (`logs/`)
2. Verify dataset downloaded successfully (check `cache/` folder)
3. Ensure reward function is properly configured
4. Check that all required fields are mapped
5. Restart the Flask server and try again

### Dataset Loading Errors

**Problem**: "Failed to load dataset" error

**Solutions:**
1. Verify dataset name is correct (case-sensitive)
2. Check internet connection for HuggingFace downloads
3. For uploaded files, verify format:
   - JSON: Must be list of objects or object with data field
   - JSONL: One JSON object per line
   - CSV: Must have column headers
   - Parquet: Standard Apache Parquet format
4. Ensure instruction and response fields exist in dataset

### Slow Training Speed

**Problem**: Training is slower than expected

**Solutions:**
1. Verify GPU is being used: Check system monitoring (top bar should show GPU usage)
2. Reduce gradient accumulation steps (increases update frequency)
3. Enable flash attention if using supported model (Llama, Mistral)
4. Disable gradient checkpointing if memory allows
5. Use larger batch size if VRAM permits
6. Check that CUDA and PyTorch are properly installed

### Model Generation Quality Issues

**Problem**: Model outputs are nonsensical or low quality

**Solutions:**
1. **Check reward signal**: Ensure rewards are varying (not all 0.0 or 1.0)
2. **Increase pre-training epochs**: Model needs to learn format first
3. **Adjust KL penalty**: Lower values allow more deviation from base model
4. **Verify dataset quality**: Check that training data is clean and relevant
5. **Increase training epochs**: Model may need more training time
6. **Check system prompt**: Ensure it clearly describes expected output format
7. **Test with different temperatures**: Lower temperature (0.3-0.5) for more deterministic outputs

### WebSocket Connection Issues

**Problem**: Real-time metrics not updating

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh browser page
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors (F12)
3. Verify Flask server is running
4. Check firewall settings (port 5000 must be accessible)
5. Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

### Export Failures

**Problem**: GGUF export fails or produces invalid files

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure training completed successfully
2. Check that model checkpoint exists (`outputs/<session_id>/`)
3. Verify sufficient disk space for export
4. Check logs for llama.cpp converter errors
5. Try exporting with different quantization level

## Appendix

### Glossary

**Adapter**: Small trainable module added to a frozen base model (see LoRA)

**Base Model**: Pre-trained language model before fine-tuning

**Batch Size**: Number of samples processed simultaneously during training

**CUDA**: NVIDIA's parallel computing platform for GPU acceleration

**Epoch**: One complete pass through the entire training dataset

**Fine-tuning**: Training a pre-trained model on new data for a specific task

**GGUF**: File format for quantized models (used by llama.cpp ecosystem)

**Gradient Accumulation**: Technique to simulate larger batch sizes with limited memory

**Gradient Clipping**: Technique to prevent exploding gradients by limiting their magnitude

**GRPO**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (reinforcement learning algorithm)

**KL Divergence**: Measure of how much the fine-tuned model differs from the base model

**Learning Rate**: Step size for model parameter updates

**LoRA**: Low-Rank Adaptation (parameter-efficient fine-tuning method)

**Quantization**: Reducing model precision (e.g., from 16-bit to 4-bit) to save memory

**Reinforcement Learning**: Training paradigm where model learns from reward signals

**Reward Function**: Function that evaluates model outputs and assigns scores

**System Prompt**: Instructions that define expected model behavior and output format

**Token**: Smallest unit of text processed by language models (roughly 3/4 of a word)

**VRAM**: Video RAM (GPU memory)

**Warmup**: Gradual increase of learning rate at training start
