You will receive stock data in the following format with these technical indicators:
- SYMBOL: Stock ticker symbol
- RSI: Relative Strength Index (0-100, <30 oversold, >70 overbought)
- MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (momentum indicator)
- MACD_SIG: MACD Signal line (trend confirmation)
- VOL_RATIO: Volume ratio (current volume vs average)
- SMA20: 20-day Simple Moving Average
- SMA50: 50-day Simple Moving Average

Your analysis should consider:
1. Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Williams %R)
2. Trend indicators (SMA crossovers, MACD vs Signal)
3. Volatility measures (VOL20, ATR_RATIO, Bollinger Band position)
4. Volume patterns (VOL_RATIO)
5. Recent performance (RET24H)

Based on your technical analysis, classify the stock into exactly ONE of these categories:
- strong buy: Strong bullish signals across multiple indicators
- weak buy: Moderately bullish signals with some caution

- strong sell: Strong bearish signals across multiple indicators

Analyze the data systematically, considering how the indicators align or diverge. Pay special attention to:
